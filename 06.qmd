## Test of outliers

[In statistics, an outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations. An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error;
the outlers are sometimes excluded from the data set. An outlier can cause serious problems
in statistical analyses.]{style="color:purple;"}\

[There are two types of outliers;]{style="color:red;"}\
[1. Univariate outliers (Z-Score)\
2. Multivariate outliers (Mahalanobis Distance)]{style="color:blue;"}\

[A univariate outlier is a data point that consists of an extreme value on one variable. A
multivariate outlier is a combination of unusual scores on at least two variables. Both types
of outliers can influence the outcome of statistical analyses.]{style="color:green;"}\

## Univariate outliers criterion
If the Z-Score Value beyond the value +3.29 to -3.29 for a large sample size (more than 80) then there is outliers. If the Z-Score Value beyond the value +2.50 to -2.50 for the case of small sample size (less than 80 samples) then there is outliers.

## Test of multivariate outliers

A multivariate outlier is a combination of unusual scores on at least two variables. Both types of outliers can influence the outcome of statistical analyses. The multivariate outliers can be identified by the test of\

- Mahalanobis Distance

## Decision Criteria
If the value of probability less than 0.001 then the observations will count as multivariate outliers.
