# Regression Analysis

In statistical modelling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.\

## Simple Linear Regression

- Linear regression models are used to show or predict the relationship between two variables or factors. The factor that is being predicted (the factor that the equation solves for) is called the dependent variable. The factors that are used to predict the value of the dependent variable are called the independent variables.\
- The simplest form of a regression analysis uses one dependent variable and one independent variable.\

## Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical
technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable.\
