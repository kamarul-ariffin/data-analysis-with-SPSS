"Normal" data are data that are drawn (come from) a population that has a normal distribution.
This distribution is unarguably the most important and the most frequently used distribution in
both the theory and application of statistics. There are two types of data normality;\

1. Univariate data normality (Skewness & Kurtosis)\
2. Multivariate data normality (Mardia Test)\
