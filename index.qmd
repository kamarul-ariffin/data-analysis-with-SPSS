This module provides a comprehensive guide to conducting data analysis using SPSS, a widely used statistical software. It is structured into a step-by-step process that covers the entire workflow, from data preparation to advanced statistical tests. Key components include:\

1. **Introduction:** An overview of SPSS software and its role in statistical analysis.
Data Inputs in SPSS Software: Instructions on importing and organizing data within SPSS, including file formats and data entry techniques.\
2. **Data Transformation:** Techniques to prepare data for analysis, such as recoding variables and computing new ones.\
3. **Descriptive Statistics:** Procedures for summarizing and describing data distributions, including measures of central tendency and dispersion.\
4. **Test of Data Normality:** Methods for assessing the normality of data using skewness and kurtosis.\
5. **Test of Outliers:** Identification and handling of outliers in both univariate and multivariate data sets.\
6. **Test of Data Reliability:** Evaluation of the internal consistency of scales using Cronbach’s Alpha.\
7. **Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA):** Techniques to uncover underlying structures in the data and reduce dimensionality.\
8. **T-Tests:** Application of one-sample, independent sample, and paired sample t-tests to compare means across groups or conditions.\
9. **ANOVA Tests:** Use of one-way, two-way, and repeated-measures ANOVA for analyzing variance among multiple groups.\
10. **Correlation Tests:** Examination of relationships between variables using correlation coefficients.\
11. **Regression Analysis:** Implementation of simple and multiple linear regression to model relationships between dependent and independent variables.\
\
The module equips users with practical knowledge and step-by-step guidance to conduct data analysis in SPSS effectively, catering to both beginners and intermediate users. It emphasizes the integration of statistical theory with practical application, making it a valuable resource for researchers, students, and professionals in various fields.\

SPSS is a software used for statistical analysis\
First released in 1968 and was developed by Normane H. Bent and C. Hadial Hull\
Since its release, SPSS was under SPSS Inc.\
However in July 28, 2009 SPSS was acquired by IBM for US$1.2 billion\
Versions 17 and 18 were known as PASW (Predictive and Analytical Software)\
Version 19 was renamed as SPSS Statistics\
