The factor that is being predicted (the factor that the equation solves for) is called the dependent variable. The factors that are used to predict the value of the dependent variable are called the independent variables.\\\n- The simplest form of a regression analysis uses one dependent variable and one independent variable.\\\n\n![](images/slides/img_Page_137.png)\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Hypothesis\"}\nH1: Wage has a significant effect on employee performance\\\nH2: Welfare has a significant effect on employee performance\\\nH3: Fringe benefits has a significant effect on employee performance\\\n:::\n\n![](images/slides/img_Page_139.png)\n\n![](images/slides/img_Page_140.png)\n\n![](images/slides/img_Page_141.png)\n\n![](images/slides/img_Page_142.png)\n\n![](images/slides/img_Page_143.png)\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Results Interpretation\"}\n[B-Value:]{style=\"color:red;\"} [Unstandardized coefficients are 'raw' coefficients produced by regression analysis when the analysis is performed on original, unstandardized variables. ...
